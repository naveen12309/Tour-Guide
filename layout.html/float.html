    About a Girl" is a song by English girl group Sugababes from their seventh studio 
    album, Sweet 7 (2010). RedOne produced the song and wrote it in collaboration with
     Makeba Riddick. It is an uptempo europop and future house song with a dance-inspired 
     middle eight. The song was released on 8 November 2009 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 
     as the album's second single. "About a Girl" is the first single to feature vocals by band
      member Jade Ewen, following the departure of Keisha Buchanan, the last remaining original member, in September 2009.

    Critical response to the song was mixed. Some critics praised it as a standout track from Sweet 7, 
    although other criticised it as unoriginal and generic. The song peaked at number eight on the UK 
    Singles Chart, number four on the Scottish Singles Chart, and inside the top twenty on the Irish 
    Singles Chart. It additionally charted in Poland and Slovakia. The music video for the song was 
    filmed in September 2009 amid the group's controversial line-up change. It was directed by Martin 
    Weisz and filmed at Vasquez Rocks, near Los Angeles. The video has a Kill Bill theme, and features 
    stunt doubles fighting businessmen in a 
    caravan. The Sugababes performed the song on GMTV, at Children in Need, and at the UK Asian Music Awards.
